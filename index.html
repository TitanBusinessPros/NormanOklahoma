    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <div class="content-flex">
      <div>
        <p>
          Based in <strong>Oklahoma City</strong>, we‚Äôre a team of technology enthusiasts who *love* building and modifying software ‚Äî  
          whether it‚Äôs <strong>RTS Games</strong>, <strong>RPG Games</strong>, mobile apps, chat bots, or complex business systems.  
          Debugging isn‚Äôt a chore for us; it‚Äôs a lifestyle. We take ideas and level them up into powerful, usable, and fun technology.  
          We also specialize in <strong>software modifications under the MIT License</strong>.  
          In Norman, that means bringing our laptops to Gray Owl Coffee, one of the city‚Äôs most popular spots for  
          creative minds and entrepreneurs. Over cappuccinos and pour-overs, we‚Äôve mapped out website designs,  
          brainstormed SEO strategies, and even drawn character sketches for RPG games. We love being part of  
          Norman‚Äôs tech-meets-arts culture, and Gray Owl is just one example of how local businesses inspire our work.

        <p>
          From Campus Corner near the University of Oklahoma to the quiet neighborhoods around Brookhaven,  
          Norman is filled with unique businesses and organizations that need a digital voice.  
          We‚Äôre here to build it for them. Sometimes that means stopping by The Mont for a casual meeting ‚Äî  
          its legendary queso and swirls make for a perfect brainstorming session. Other times,  
          we‚Äôve met with clients at The Diner, a down-to-earth Norman institution that has been featured  
          on national TV for its classic breakfast and lunch menu. And when it‚Äôs time to celebrate  
          a project launch in style, we‚Äôve gathered with partners at Blu Fine Wine & Food,  
          a high-class restaurant where great cuisine meets great conversation. These connections  
          are not just meals; they‚Äôre part of the way Norman businesses build relationships, and we‚Äôre proud  
          to be part of that story.

    <h2>Free Websites</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      üíí We proudly create <strong>Free Websites</strong> for <strong>churches</strong>, <strong>charities</strong>,

      We are based in <strong>Oklahoma City</strong>, but we help anyone nationwide who qualifies for free website services.  
      In Norman, our commitment to service has taken us to events at Andrews Park, where nonprofits often host  
      community gatherings, and to the Norman Public Library, where small business owners gather to learn and share resources.  
      Whether meeting a local pastor for coffee at Gray Owl, talking with volunteers at The Diner over a hearty breakfast,  
      or connecting with nonprofit directors at Blu during an evening dinner, our free website program is part of the  
      same mission: to empower the Norman community with tools that make a lasting difference.
